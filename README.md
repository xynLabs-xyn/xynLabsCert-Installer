## What Does This Software Do?

This software installs the xynLabs self-signed certificate into your Trusted Root.  
xyn created this certificate so that his current and future software can be signed by his custom certificate.  
This prevents his software from being quarantined or removed by Windows Security/Defender  
without having to spend a ton of cash and time to get a "ReCoGnIzEd PrOvIdEr" to vouch for him — which, by the way, anyone with money and time could do if they wanted to infect someone's rig with malware.

## Transparency and Trust

This repository is public so you can see exactly what it does.  
If you don't speak code, I recommend using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) — it's free to use.  
You can paste any code into it and ask questions like:

- *What does this do?*
- *Explain it to me like I know nothing about anything.*
- *Is it harmful?*
- *Will xyn take my bank account?*
- *Do I have the right to an attorney?*
- *Can everything I say be used against me in a court of law?*

You get the point. There is no malicious intent here, and if there were, you probably wouldn't know about it.  
We're just trying to get by here... :^)
