# xynLabsCert-Installer
You need to Right-click -> Run As Administrator for this to install correctly.
Those are the only installation instructions you will need, it's just Next, Install, Finish.
Make sure you've read everything so you don't feel tricked.
If you don't trust xyn, then don't do it.

# This software installs xynLabs self-signed certificate into your Trusted Root
xyn created this so that his current and future software can be signed by his custom certificate, and not quarantined and/or removed by pesky Windows security/defender
without having to spend a ton of ca$h and t!me to get a 'ReCoGnIzEd PrOvIdEr' to vouch for him -
like any person with money and time could do anyway if they wanted to infect someones rig with malware.

This repository is public so you can see exactly what it does, if you don't speak code - I'd like to direct you to https://chatgpt.com/
ChatGPT is free to use and you can paste any code to it and ask things like;
What does this do?
Explain it to me like I know nothing about anything.
Is it harmful?
Will xyn take my bank account?
Do I have the right to an attorney?
Can everything I say be used against me in a court of law?

...
You get the point.
There is no malicious intent here, and if there was you probably wouldn't know about it,
just trying to get by here... :^)

Any questions? Ask and ye shall receive.
